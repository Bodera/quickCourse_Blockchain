## Beyond cryptocurrencies

Do you know what blockchain is? Surely you've heard of bitcoin, right? But did you also know that blockchain goes far beyond cryptocurrencies? Well, blockchain is the technology that allows peer-to-peer commercial transactions, that is, without intermediaries.

In the blockchain you can exchange confidential information, sign contracts, transfer money, track products, all with the guarantee of veracity, security, privacy, in addition to reducing time and cost. For this reason, it has attracted the interest of large companies, banks and governments. That is, both individuals and companies and public and private networks are already adopting this technology. You know how? Do you know who is behind the scenes making blockchain happen? Every transaction you initiate is transferred to all nodes in the network, this network verifies your information and validates your transaction. This transaction is then combined with other transactions to create a new hash for the ledger. The new block encrypted by the miner is permanently added to a blockchain and the miner receives a reward. Ready! The finalization is finished, the data is safe and will not be changed, as simple as that! Well, more or less of it...
